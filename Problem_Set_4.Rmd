## Question 1

### a.

We would expect 𝛽~1~ to be positive at the beginning. This would be an indicator that low levels of income, economic development leads to an environmental degradation. We would also expect 𝛽~2~ to be negative because at a certain threshold, as income increases the coeffecient should reflect the decreasing environmental degradation. 

### b.

The coefficient estimate for 𝛽~1~ is 2.2 which indicates that a 1% increase in the natural logarithm of GDP per capita is associated with a 2.2% increase in the natural logarathim of air particulate population.

### c.

The coefficient estimate for 𝛽~1~ is 0.002 which indicates that a 1% increase in the natural logarithm of GDP per capita is associated with a 0.002% increase in the natural logarithm of air particulate polluiton. 

### d.

According to the table the constant coefficient (𝛽~0~) and population constant (𝛽~2~) are statistically significant. This is determined by both of their p-values being less than 0.05. 

## Question 2

### a.

𝛽~0~ in this regression represents the intercept, which is the expected number of elephants poached when a ranger has zero years of experience and has not attended the special enforcement training program. 

### b.

For 𝛽~1~ the sign would be negative. This is an indicator that as a ranger gains more experience, they become more effective at reducing poaching. For 𝛽~2~ the sign would be negative as well. This indicates that rangers who have attended the training program are effective at reducing poaching. For 𝛽~3~ the sign would be positive. This shows that the impact of training is more pronounced for less experienced rangers. This essentially means that the training program has a stronger positive effect on reducing poaching. 

### c.

Given these estimates the equation for the impact of of attending the enforcement training program on poaching is Impact of Training = 𝛽~2~ + 𝛽~3~ * experience ~i~
After substituting the values into the equation it is
Impact of training = -15 + 2 * experience ~i~
After solving for experience ~i~ we get 7.5. Which means that when a ranger has about 7.5 years of experience the training program has zero effect on the number of elephants poached.
